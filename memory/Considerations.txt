Threading
=================================

We are using the same data types for single threaded and multi threaded purpose.

Advantages:
    1. Only one data type to maintain
    2. We can switch between multi threaded and single threaded use for the same instantiation
        for additional performance

Disadvantages:
    1. There is the risk that the _atomic functions are bugged because we no longer define them volatile?
    2. Other platforms may not allow our very simple wrappers around atomic functions.

Templates
=================================

We are supporting template types in some cases which hopefully provide better optimizations during compile time.
When profiling those we had very mixed results.

Not sure if the additional code really provides performance benefits. This needs to be investigated further.
If it doesn't provide any benefits using the general purpose solution with element_size could be better,
because we then only have to maintain one solution
